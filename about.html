  <p>
    I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Concordia University with a strong passion for
    motorsports and high-performance vehicle systems. Through Formula SAE and extensive
    hands-on manufacturing experience, I have developed a deep interest in suspension systems,
    dampers, aerodynamics, and vehicle dynamics.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy combining theory with practical implementation, whether through machining parts,
    building prototypes, or validating designs through testing and analysis.
