    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      As a member of Concordia Formula SAE, I contributed to multiple vehicle subsystems with a
      focus on performance-driven design. My work spanned aerodynamics, suspension and damper
      understanding, and vehicle dynamics, combining theoretical analysis with manufacturing
      and practical implementation.

    <h2>Aerodynamics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Contributed to aerodynamic concept development to improve downforce and airflow consistency</li>
      <li>Analyzed aerodynamic trade-offs with vehicle mass, balance, and packaging constraints</li>
      <li>Considered manufacturability and structural integration of aerodynamic components</li>
      <li>Worked closely with vehicle dynamics considerations to ensure balanced performance</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2>Suspension & Dampers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Assisted in suspension geometry development with emphasis on handling and adjustability</li>
      <li>Studied damper force–velocity characteristics and their influence on ride, grip, and transient response</li>
      <li>Analyzed the role of damping in controlling oscillations and maintaining tire contact</li>
      <li>Developed a strong understanding of why dampers are critical yet often overlooked performance components</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Vehicle Dynamics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Applied vehicle dynamics principles to understand load transfer and handling balance</li>
      <li>Linked suspension and aerodynamic decisions to overall vehicle performance</li>
      <li>Supported setup discussions using theoretical and practical understanding</li>
      <li>Focused on performance optimization rather than purely component-level design</li>
    </ul>
